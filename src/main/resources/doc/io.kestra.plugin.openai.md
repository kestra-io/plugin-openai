# How to use the OpenAI plugin

Call OpenAI models for chat completions, image generation, and file management from Kestra flows.

## Authentication

Set `apiKey` to your OpenAI API key. Store it in a [secret](https://kestra.io/docs/concepts/secret). Optionally set `organizationId` to scope requests to a specific organization, or override `baseUrl` to point at an OpenAI-compatible endpoint such as Azure OpenAI.

## Tasks

`ChatCompletion` sends a list of messages to a model and returns the response — use it for single-turn prompts, summarization, classification, or any conversational interaction. `Responses` calls the newer OpenAI Responses API, which is better suited for agentic use cases with tool calls and multi-step reasoning.

`CreateImage` generates an image via DALL-E given a text prompt. `UploadFile` uploads a file to OpenAI — use it to prepare training data for fine-tuning.
